# Overview

This module is designed to be used with Node Cluster in production:
* one log file for all workers
* compatible with logrotate: an USR2 signal reopen the log file

This module is compatible with node 0.8.x. For the node 0.6.x, please use version 0.0.1 of this module.

This module is inspired from [this module](https://github.com/visionmedia/log.js).

# How to use it

## Installation

    npm install log4node

## Usage

Default logger:
```js
var log = require('log4node');

log.error("this is a log");
```
Will output to console.

Note: you can reconfigure default logger by calling

    log.reconfigure({level: 'info', file: 'toto.log'});

Will now write into `toto.log`

Your custom logger:
```js
var log4node = require('log4node');
    log = new log4node.Log4Node({level: 'warning', file: 'test.log'});

log.error("this is a log");
log.debug("this is a debug log");
```

Note : you can use the syntax accepted by [`utils.format`](http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_format_format).

## Log level

Log level can be adjusted for each logger:

    log.setLogLevel('info');

Log level for default logger is 'info'.

Available log levels are:

* emergency
* alert
* critical
* error
* warning
* notice
* info
* debug

## Prefix

Prefix of log lines can be changed:

```js
log.setPrefix("%d - %p ");
```

You can use following field in prefix:
* `%d`: current date
* `%p`: current process id
* `%l`: log level

Default prefix is: `[%d] %l `

## Cluster mode

Workers processes will send logs to the cluster master for writing to file.

Setup is fully transparent for developper.

A full example can be found [here](https://github.com/bpaquet/log4node/blob/master/test/cluster/test1.js).

## Reopen log file

Just send USR2 signal to node process, or, in cluster mode, to master node process:

    kill -USR2 pid

Example of logrotate file:

    /var/log/node.log {
      rotate 5
      weekly
      postrotate
        kill -USR2 `cat process.pid`
      endscript
    }

## Create a specialized logger
This feature is provided to specialize a logger for a sub-component.
You can create a new logger with its own level and prefix for a sub-component.
The logs will be send to the same files with a prefix.

```js
log = new log4node.Log4Node('warning', 'test.log');
sublogger1 = log.clone({prefix:'SUBMODULE - ', level:'error');
```

or with the default logger

```js
sublogger1 = log4node.clone(prefix:'SUBMODULE - ', level:'error');
```
